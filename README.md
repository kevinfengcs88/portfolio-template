# Portfolio template
This is a minimalistic template for a portfolio website that was built from scratch along with some [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) elements. To view an example, check out
[kevinfeng.ga](https://kevinfeng.ga/). 

## How to use
1. Download the files `index.html`, `styles.css`, and optionally, `favicon.ico`. I would recommend using your own favicon; there are plenty of resources to help you generate your own, including [favicon.ico](https://favicon.io/).
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite code editor
3. Replace instances of `/fill in/` with whatever you like (this includes links, make sure to format them properly)
4. Replace instances of `Lorem ipsum` text with whatever you like 
5. Upload your files to your hosting service, and you're done!
